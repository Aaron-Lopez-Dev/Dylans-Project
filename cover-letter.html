        <h3>To Whom It May Concern: </h3><br>
        <p>I am writing to express my interest in a systems or diagnostics engineering role at your organization. 
            With over seven years of experience in software configuration, diagnostics, and cross-platform troubleshooting, I bring a strong 
            technical foundation and a proven ability to lead, collaborate, and solve problems in high-pressure environments.</p><br>
        <p>At Tesla, I currently serve as a Lead Diagnostic Specialist, where I manage system-level troubleshooting across Linux and Windows platforms. I 
            collaborate closely with engineering teams to streamline diagnostic procedures, implement process improvements, and ensure optimal system 
            performance using tools like Ubuntu, VMware, JIRA, and SharePoint. My background also includes leadership experience at Jenkins Nissan, 
            where I led a team of 25 technicians and drove service operations with a focus on safety, training, and efficiency.</p><br>
        <p>With a technical education in Computer Engineering and Electrical Technology, along with achievements such as first place at the SkillsUSA 
            Electronics Technology Conference and participation in NASA’s Aerospace Scholars Program, 
            I am confident in my ability to add value to your team from day one.</p><br>
        <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your company’s needs. 
            Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you further.</p><br>

        <span>Sincerely, </span><br>
        <span><strong>Dylan Craig</strong></span>
